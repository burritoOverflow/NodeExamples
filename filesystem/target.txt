Almost at the same time the mortality among the livestock 
commenced. Poultry turned greyish and died very quickly, 
their meat being found dry and noisome upon cutting. 
Hogs grew inordinately fat, then suddenly began to undergo 
loathsome changes which no one could explain. 
Their meat was of course useless, and Nahum was at 
his wit’s end. No rural veterinary would approach his place,
 and the city veterinary from Arkham was openly baffled. 
 The swine began growing grey and brittle and falling 
 to pieces before they died, and their eyes and muzzles 
 developed singular alterations. It was very inexplicable, 
 for they had never been fed from the tainted vegetation. 
 Then something struck the cows. Certain areas or sometimes 
 the whole body would be uncannily shrivelled or compressed, 
 and atrocious collapses or disintegrations were common. 
 In the last stages—and death was always the result—there 
 would be a greying and turning brittle like that which beset the 
 hogs. There could be no question of poison, for all the 
 cases occurred in a locked and undisturbed barn. No bites 
 of prowling things could have brought the virus, for what live 
 beast of earth can pass through solid obstacles? It must be only 
 natural disease—yet what disease could wreak such results was 
 beyond any mind’s guessing. When the harvest came there was not 
 an animal surviving on the place, for the stock and poultry were 
 dead and the dogs had run away. These dogs, three in number, had 
 all vanished one night and were never heard of again. 
 The five cats had left some time before, but their going was 
 scarcely noticed since there now seemed to be no mice, and only Mrs. 
 Gardner had made pets of the graceful felines.
